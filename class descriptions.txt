TODO: 
    * Back Button (Restores the game to the previous move)
    * Moves Logger option from command line (Gives UI a scrollable list of all previously played moves)
    * UI enabled option for command line (Gives the possibility to take away UI i.e. go headless)

Known bugs:
    * Some moves only get counted in some instances.
    * Starting new game does NOT reset all states for players
