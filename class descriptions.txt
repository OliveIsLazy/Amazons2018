chessGUI => JPanel to represent the chess board
HumanPlayer => Store data about itself
Game => Store data about the game + main game loop that updates chessGUI

TODO:
    * Change Algorithm implementations to return full board with the change made rather than just a single move
    * Add Machine Learning algorithms:
        + K-nearest neighbors
        + SVM
        + Q-Learning (multiple versions)
        + Genetic algorithm + neural network
        + Capsule network (for the lolz)

Known bugs:
    * Some moves only get counted in some instances.
    * Starting new game does NOT reset all states for players
    * Loading an incompatible file adds unwanted arrows to the board
