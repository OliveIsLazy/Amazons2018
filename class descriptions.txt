Way to run:
    human v human -> java all the way
    human v bot -> java all the way or java args + game logic -> python Brain
    bot v bot -> java all the way or java args + game logic -> python Brain
    bot learning -> java for args -> python for repetition -> java for game logic -> python Brain


Java:
    chessGUI => JPanel to represent the chess board
    Game => Store data about the game + main game loop that updates chessGUI
    Abstract/Human/BotPlayer => player representation
    Algorithm => interface to be implemented for a bot

Python:
    Communicator => decodes pipe information from Java
    Brain => handles decoded data and turns it into new move

TODO:
    * Send JSON to python algorithm and adjust response method to not decode board right away
    * Add Machine Learning algorithms to MCTS:
        + K-nearest neighbors (?)
        + SVM (?)
        + Q-Learning (multiple versions)
        + Genetic algorithm + neural network
        + Capsule network (for the lolz its not gonna be good but its funny)

Known bugs:
    * Some moves only get counted in some instances.
    * Starting new game does NOT reset all states for players
    * Loading an incompatible file adds unwanted arrows to the board
    * When asked to select a shot, clicking on the moved pawn will cause buggy behavior
    * Back button doesn't work against a bot




MCTS:
    * BUG TO FIX: Somehow, somewhere, pieces get overwritten with an arrow
