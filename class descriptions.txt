TODO:
    * Add Machine Learning algorithms:
        + K-nearest neighbors (?)
        + SVM (?)
        + Q-Learning (multiple versions)
        + Genetic algorithm + neural network
        + Capsule network (for the lolz its not gonna be good but its funny)

Known bugs:
    * Some moves only get counted in some instances.
    * Starting new game does NOT reset all states for players
    * Loading an incompatible file adds unwanted arrows to the board
